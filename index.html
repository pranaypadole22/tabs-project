              <h4>history</h4>
              <p>
                 <b>Ancient Period:</b> Raigad Fort, located in the Sahyadri mountain range in Maharashtra, has a long history. It was
                originally known as Rairi and was under the control of various local chiefs and kingdoms before the rise of the
                Marathas. <br><br>
                <b>Maratha Empire:</b> The fort is most famous for being the capital of the Maratha Empire under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
                In 1674, Shivaji was coronated as the Chhatrapati (King) of the Maratha Empire at Raigad Fort, marking the fort's
                prominence in Indian history. It served as the base for the Maratha administration and military operations. <br><br>
                <b>Strategic Importance:</b> The fort's location on a hilltop made it a formidable defense post. It has several significant
                structures, including the King’s Palace, the Queen’s quarters, the Balekilla (upper fort), and the Samadhi (memorial) of
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. <br><br>
                
              <b>British Period:</b> After the fall of the Maratha Empire, the British took over the fort in 1818, marking the end of its use
                as a military stronghold.
